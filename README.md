2. Random IPS NFT
    - random at creation time
    - give true scarcity and randomness to NFT
    - hosted on IPFS
    - Pros: Cheap
    - Cons: Someone needs to pin our data

3. Dynamic SVG NFT
    - image changes based on some parameters
    - hosted on-chain
    - Pros: The data is stored on chain!
    - Cons: MUCH more expensive in terms of gas costs
